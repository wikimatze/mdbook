# What

An own written script to generate a HTML version out of markdown files. This code was written for the generation of the HTML version of [padrinobook](http://padrinobook.com/) - the markdown files are on [GitHub](https://github.com/wikimatze/PadrinoBook).


# Usage

Copy all your markdown files in the `chapters` folder. Next run `ruby tilt.rb` and it will generate HTML files in the
`output folder`.


Start `watchr watch.rb` to constantly build the markdown files and refresh your HTML.


# TBD

- Add gem versions
- copy assets in output folder
- <`2:`>fixing gumby icon links
- <`3:`>think about JavaScript and fix the TOC
