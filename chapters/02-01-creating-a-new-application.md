## Creating a new application

Start with generating a new project with the canonical `padrino` command. In contrast to our "Hello World!" application
(app) before, we are using new options:


{: lang="bash" }
    $ mkdir ~/padrino-projects
    $ cd ~/padrino_projects
    $ padrino g project job-vacancy -d activerecord -t rspec -s jquery -e erb -a sqlite


Explanation of the fields commands:


- **g**: Is shortcut for `generate`.
- **-d activerecord**: We are using [Active Record](https://rubygems.org/gems/activerecord "Active Record") as the orm
  library (*Object Relational Mapper*).
- **-t rspec**: We are using the [RSpec](https://github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/wiki/get-in-touch "RSpec") testing
  framework.
- **-s jquery**: Defining the JavaScript library we are using - for this app will be using the ubiquitous
  [jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery") library.
- **-e erb**: We are using [ERB](http://ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/erb/rdoc/ERB.html "ERB") (*embedded ruby*)
  markup for writing HTML templates. An alternative is [Haml](http://haml.info/ "Haml") or [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/
  "Slim"), but to keep the project as simple as possible, we stick with ERB. Feel free to use them if you like to.
- **-a sqlite**: Our ORM[^orm] database adapter is [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org/ "SQLite"). It is easy to install
  because the whole database is saved in a text file.


Since we are using RSpec for testing, we will use its' built-in mock extensions
[rspec-mocks](https://github.com/rspec/rspec-mocks "rspec mocks") for writing tests later. In case you want to use
another mocking library like [rr](https://rubygems.org/gems/rr "rr") or [mocha](http://gofreerange.com/mocha/docs/
"mocha"), feel free to add it with the **-m** option.


You can use a vast array of other options when generating your new Padrino app, this table shows the currently available
options:


- `orm`: Available options are: `activerecord, couchrest,  datamapper, mongoid, mongomatic,
  ohm, ripple`, and `sequel`. The command line alias is `-d`.
- `test`: Availabe options are: `bacon, cucumber, minitest, riot, rspec, should`, and `testspec`. The command line
  alias is `-t`.
- `script`: Available options are: `dojo, extcore, jquery, mootools, prototype`, and `rightjs`. The command line alias
  is `-s`.
- `renderer`: Available options are: `erb, haml, liquid`, and `slim`. The command line alias is `-e`.
- `stylesheet`: Available options are: `compass, less, sass`, and `scss`. The command line alias is `-c`.
- `mock`: Available options are: `mocha` and `rr`.


The default value of each option is none. So to in order to use them you have to specify the option you want to use.


Besides the `project` option for generating new Padrino apps, the following table illustrates the other generators
available:


- `admin`: A very nice built-in admin dashboard.
- `admin_page`: Creates for an existing model the CRUD operation for the admin interface.
- `app`: You can define other apps to be mounted in your main app.
- `controller`: A controller takes date from the models and puts them into view that are rendered.
- `mailer`: Creating new mailers within your app.
- `migration`: Migrations simplify changing the database schema.
- `model`: Models describe data objects of your application.
- `project`: Generates a completely new app from the scratch.
- `plugin`: Creating new Padrino projects based on a template file - it's like a list of commands.


Later, when *the time comes*, we will add extra gems, for now though we'll grab the current gems using
`bundle` by running at the command line:


{: lang="bash" }
    $ bundle install


### Basic Layout Template

Lets design our first version of the *index.html* page which is the starter page our app. An early design
question is: Where to put the *index.html* page? Because we are not working with controllers, the easiest thing is to
put the *index.html* directly under the public folder in the project.


We are using [HTML5](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5 "HTML5") for the page, and add the following code into
`public/index.html`:


{: lang="html" }
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <title>Start Page</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <p>Hello, Padrino!</p>
      </body>
    </html>


Explanation of the parts:


- `<!DOCTYPE html>` - The *document type* tells the browser which HTML version should be used for rendering the content
  correctly.
- `<head>...</head>` - Specifying meta information like title, description, and other things, this is also the place to
  where to add CSS and JavaScript files.
- `<body>...</body>` - In this section the main content of the page is displayed.


Plain static content - this used to be the way websites were created in the beginning of the web. Today, apps provide
dynamic layout. During this chapter, we will se how to add more and more dynamic parts to our app.


We can take a look at our new page by executing the following command:


{: lang="bash" }
    $ cd job-vacancy
    $ bundle exec padrino start


You should see a message telling you that Padrino has taken the stage, and you should be able to view our created index
page by visiting [http://localhost:3000/index.html](http://localhost:3000/index.html "index.html") in your
browser.


But hey, you might ask "Why do we use the `bundle exec` command - isn't just `padrino start` enough?" The reason for
this is that we use bundler to load exactly those Ruby gems that we specified in the Gemfile. I recommend that you use
`bundle exec` for all following commands, but to focus on Padrino, I will skip this command on the following parts of
the book.


You may have thought it a little odd that we had to manually requests the index.html in the URL when viewing our start
page.  This is because our app currently has no idea about **routing**. Routing is the process to recognize requeste
URLs and to forward these requests to actions of controllers. With other words: A router is like a like vending machine
where you put in money to get a coke. In this case, the machine is the *router* which *routes* your input "Want a coke"
to the action "Drop a Coke in the tray".


### First Controller And Routing

Lets add some basic routes for displaying our home, about, and contact-page. How can we do this? With the help of a
routing controller. A controller makes data from you app (in our case job offers) available to the view (seeing the
details of a job offer). Now let's create a controller in Padrino names page:


{: lang="bash" }
    $ padrino g controller page


The output of this command is:


{: lang="bash" }
    create  app/controllers/page.rb
    create  app/helpers/page_helper.rb
    create  app/views/page
     apply  tests/rspec
    create  spec/app/controllers/page_controller_spec.rb


(If you have questions about the output above, please drop me a line - I think it is so clear that it doesn't need any
explanation about it.)


Lets take a closer look at our page-controller:


{: lang="ruby" }
    # app/controller/page.rb

    JobVacancy::App.controllers :page do

      # get :index, :map => '/foo/bar' do
      #   session[:foo] = 'bar'
      #   render 'index'
      # end

      # get :sample, :map => '/sample/url', :provides => [:any, :js] do
      #   case content_type
      #     when :js then ...
      #     else ...
      # end

      # get :foo, :with => :id do
      #   'Maps to url '/foo/#{params[:id]}''
      # end

      # get '/example' do
      #   'Hello world!'
      # end

    end


The controller above defines for our `JobVacancy` the `:page` controller with no specified routes inside the
app. Let's change this and define the *about*, *contact*, and *home* actions:


{: lang="ruby" }
    # app/controller/page.rb

    JobVacancy:.App.controllers :page do
      get :about, :map => '/about' do
        render :erb, 'page/about'
      end

      get :contact , :map => '/contact' do
        render :erb, 'page/contact'
      end

      get :home, :map => '/' do
        render :erb, 'page/home'
      end

    end


We will go through each line:


- `JobVacancy::App.controller :page` - Define the namespace *page* for our JobVacancy app. Typically, the controller name
  will also be part of the route.
- `do ... end` - This expression defines a block in Ruby. Think of it as a method without a name, also called anonymous
  functions, which is passed to another function as an argument.
- `get :about, :map => '/about'` - The HTTP command *get* starts the declaration of the route followed by the *about*
  action (in the form of a Ruby symbol[^symbol]), and is finally mapped to the explicit URL */about*. When you start
  your server with `bundle exec padrino s` and visit the URL `http.//localhost:3000/about`, you can see the rendered
  output of this request.
- `render :erb, 'page/about'` - This action tells us that we want to render an the *erb* file *page/about*. This file is
  actually located at `app/views/page/about.erb` file. Normally the views are placed under
  *app/views/<controller-name>/<action-name>.<ending>*  Instead of using an ERB templates, you could also use `:haml`,
  or another template language. If you are lazy, you can leave the option for the rendering option completely out and
  leave the matching completely for Padrino.


[^symbol]: Unlike strings, symbols of the same name are initialized and exist in memory only once during a session of
ruby. This makes your programs more efficient.

To see what routes you have defined for your app just call `padrino rake routes`:


{: lang="bash" }
    $ padrino rake routes
    => Executing Rake routes ...


{: lang="bash" }
    Application: JobVacancy
    URL                  REQUEST  PATH
    (:page, :about)        GET    /about
    (:page, :contact)      GET    /contact
    (:page, :home)         GET    /


This command crawls through your app looking for delicious routes and gives you a nice overview about **URL,
REQUEST**, and **PATH**.


### App Template With ERB

Although we are now able to put content (albeit static) on our site, it would be nice to have some sort of basic styling
on our web page. First we need to generate a basic template for all pages we want to create. Lets create
*app/views/layouts/application.erb*:


{: lang="html" }
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <title>Job Vacancy - find the best jobs</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <%= yield %>
      </body>
    </html>


Let's see what is going on with the `<%= yield %>` line. At first you may ask what does the `<>` symbols mean. They are
indicators that you want to execute Ruby code to fetch data that is put into the template. Here, the `yield` command will
put the content of the called page, like *about.erb* or *contact.erb*,  into the template.


### CSS design using Twitter bootstrap

The guys at Twitter were kind enough to make their CSS framework **Twitter Bootstrap** available for everyone to use. It
is available from Github at [public repository on Github](https://github.com/twitter/bootstrap/ "repository on Github").


Padrino itself also provides built-in templates for common tasks done on web app. These
[padrino-recipes](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-recipes) help you saving time by not reinventing the wheel.
Thanks to [@arthur_chiu](http://twitter.com/#!/arthur_chiu "@arthur_chiu"), we use his
[bootstrap-plugin](https://github.com/padrino/padrino-recipes/blob/master/plugins/bootstrap_plugin.rb) by executing:


{: lang="bash" }
    $ padrino-gen plugin bootstrap

      apply  https://github.com/padrino/padrino-recipes/raw/master/plugins/bootstrap_plugin.rb
      create    public/stylesheets/bootstrap.css
      create    public/stylesheets/bootstrap-responsive.css
      create    public/javascripts/bootstrap.js
      create    public/javascripts/bootstrap.min.js
      create    public/images/glyphicons-halflings.png
      create    public/images/glyphicons-halflings-white.png


Next we need to include the style sheet in our app template for the whole app:


{: lang="bash" }
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <title>Job Vacancy - find the best jobs</title>
        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'bootstrap', 'bootstrap-responsive' %>
        <%= javascript_include_tag 'bootstrap.min', 'jquery', 'jquery-ujs' %>
      </head>
      <body>
        <%= yield %>
      </body>
    </html>


The `stylesheet_link_tag` points to the *bootstrap.min.css* in you app *public/stylesheets* directory and will
automatically create a link to this stylesheet. The `javascript_include_tag` does the same as `stylesheet_link_tag` for
your JavaScript files in the *public/javascripts* directory.


### Using Sprockets to Manage the Asset Pipeline

[Sprockets](https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets) are a way to manage serving your assets like CSS, and JavaScript
compiling all the different files in one summarized file for each type. They make it easy to take advantage to use a
preprocessor to write your assests with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Coffesscript](http://coffeescript.org/), or
[LESS](http://lesscss.org/).


To implement Sprockets in Padrino there the following strategies:


- [rake-pipeline](https://github.com/livingsocial/rake-pipeline): Define filters that transforms directory trees.
- [grunt](http://gruntjs.com/): Set a task to compile and manage assets in JavaScript.
- [sinatra-assetpack](https://github.com/rstacruz/sinatra-assetpack): Let's you define you assets transparently in
  Sinatra.
- [padrino-sprockets](https://github.com/nightsailer/padrino-sprockets): Integrate sprockets with Padrino in the Rails
  way.


We are using the **padrino-sprockets** gem. Let's add it to our Gemfile:


{: lang="ruby" }
    # Gemfile
    gem 'padrino-sprockets', :require => ['padrino/sprockets'], :git => 'git://github.com/nightsailer/padrino-sprockets.git'


Next we need to move all our assets from the public folder in the assets folder:


{: lang="bash" }
    $ cd <path-to-your-padrino-app>
    $ mkdir -p app/assets
    $ mv public/javascript app/assets
    $ mv public/stylesheets app/assets
    $ mv public/images app/assets


Now we have to register Padrino-Sprockets in this application:


{: lang="ruby" }
    # app/app.rb
    module JobVacancy
      class App < Padrino::Application
        ...
        register Padrino::Sprockets
        sprockets
        ...
      end
    end


Next we need to determine the order of the loaded CSS files:


{: lang="ruby" }
    # app/assets/stylesheets/application.css
    /*
     * This is a manifest file that'll automatically include all the stylesheets available in this directory
     * and any sub-directories. You're free to add application-wide styles to this file and they'll appear at
     * the top of the compiled file, but it's generally better to create a new file per style scope.
     * require_self: Puts the CSS contained within this file at the precise location (puts this command
     * at the top of the generated css file
     * require_tree . means, that requiring all stylesheets from the current directory.
     *
     *= require_self
     *= require bootstrap
     *= require bootstrap-responsive
     *= require site
    */


First we are loading the `bootstrap` default css, then `bootstrap-response`, and finally our customized `site` CSS. The
`require_self` loads the file itself, to define the order that the files are loaded. This is helpful if you want to
check the order of the loaded CSS as a comment above your application without ever have to look into the source of it.


Next let's have a look into our JavaScript files:


{: lang="javascript" }
    # app/assets/javascript/application.js

    // This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into including all the files listed below.
    // Add new JavaScript/Coffee code in separate files in this directory and they'll automatically
    // be included in the compiled file accessible from http://example.com/assets/application.js
    // It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
    // the compiled file.
    //
    //= require_tree .


The interesting thing here is the `require_tree .` option. This option tells Sprockets to include all
JavaScript files in the assets folder with no specific order.


Now, we can clean up the include statements in our application template:


{: lang="erb" }
    # app/views/application.erb

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
    <head>
      <title>Job Vacancy - find the best jobs</title>
      <%= stylesheet_link_tag '/assets/application' %>
      <%= javascript_include_tag '/assets/application' %>
    </head>


Now we want to enable compression for our CSS and JavaScript files. For CSS compression Padrino Sprockets is using
[YUI compressor](https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-yui-compressor) and for JS compression the
[Uglifier](https://github.com/lautis/uglifier). We need to add these these Gems in our `Gemfiles`:


{: lang="ruby" }
    # Gemfile
    ...
    gem 'padrino-sprockets', :require => 'padrino/sprockets', :git => 'git://github.com/nightsailer/padrino-sprockets.git'
    gem 'uglifier', '2.1.1'
    gem 'yui-compressor', '0.9.6'


And finally we need to enable minifying in our production environment:


{: lang="ruby" }
    # app/app.rb
    module JobVacancy
      class App < Padrino::Application
        ...
        register Padrino::Sprockets
        sprockets :minify => (Padrino.env == :production)
      end
    end


### Navigation

Next we want to create the top-navigation for our app. So we already implemented the *page* controller with the
relevant actions. All we need is to put links to them in a navigation header for our basic layout.


{: lang="html" }
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en-US">
      <head>
        <title>Job Vacancy - find the best jobs</title>
        <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'bootstrap', 'bootstrap-responsive' %>
        <%= javascript_include_tag 'bootstrap.min', 'jquery', 'jquery-ujs' %>
        <%= stylesheet_link_tag '/stylesheets/site.css' %>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class=="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="span12 offset3">
            <span id="header">Job Vacancy Board</span>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <nav id="navigation">
              <div class="span2 offset4">
                <%= link_to 'Home', url_for(:page, :home) %>
              </div>
              <div class="span2">
                <%= link_to 'About', url_for(:page, :about) %>
              </div>
              <div class="span2">
                <%= link_to 'Contact', url_for(:page, :contact) %>
              </div>
            </nav>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="span9 offset3 site">
              <%= yield %>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </body>


Explanation of the new parts:


- `link_to` - Is a helper for creating links. The first argument is the name for the link and the second is for the URL
  (href) to which the link points to.
- `url_for` - This helper return the link which can be used as the second parameter for the `link_to` function. It
  specifies the `<:controller>, <:action>` which will be executed. You can use in your helper in your whole app to
  create clean and encapsulated URLs.


Now that the we provide links to other parts of the app, lets add some sugar-candy styling:


{: lang="css" }
    # app/assets/stylesheets/site.css

    body {
      font: 18.5px Palatino, 'Palatino Linotype', Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, sans-serif;
      text-align: justify;
    }

    #header {
      font-family: Lato;
      font-size: 40px;
      font-weight: bold;
    }

    #navigation {
      padding-top: 20px;
    }

    h1 {
      font-family: Lato;
      font-size: 30px;
      margin-bottom: 20px;
    }

    .site {
      padding: 20px;
      line-height: 1.8em;
    }


I will not explain anything at this point about CSS. If you still don't know how to use it, please go through [w3c
school css](http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp "w3c CSS") tutorial. Since we are using the asset pipeline, we
don't need to register our new CSS file in `views/application.erb` - now you will understand why we did this.


### Writing Tests


Our site does not list static entries of job offers that you write, but other users will be allowed to post job offers
from the internet to our site. We need to add this behavior to our site. To be on the sure side, we will implement this
behavior by writing tests first, then the code. We use the [RSpec](http://rspec.info/ "RSpec") testing framework for
this.


Remember when we created the *page-controller* with `padrino g controller page` ? Thereby, Padrino created a
corresponding spec file *spec/app/controller/page_controller_spec.rb* which has the following content:


{: lang="ruby" }
    require 'spec_helper'

    describe "PageController" do
      before do
        get "/"
      end

      it "returns hello world" do
        last_response.body.should == "Hello World"
      end
    end


Let's update that file and write some basic tests to make sure that everything is working as expected. Replace the specs
in the file with the following code:


{: lang="ruby" }
    require 'spec_helper'

    describe "PageController" do

      describe "GET #about" do

        it "renders the :about view" do
          get '/about'
          last_response.should be_ok
        end
      end

      describe "GET #contact" do

        it "renders the :contact view" do
          get '/contact'
          last_response.should be_ok
        end
      end

      describe "GET #home" do
        it "renders :home view" do
          get '/'
          last_response.should be_ok
        end
      end

    end


Let's explain the interesting parts:


- `spec_helper` - Is a file to load commonly used functions to setup the tests.
- `describe block` - This block describes the context for our tests. Think of it as way to group related tests.
- `get ...` - This command executes a HTTP GET to the provided address.
- `last_response` - The response object returns the header and body of the HTTP request.


Now let's run the tests with `rspec spec/app/page_controller_spec.rb` and see what's going on:


{: lang="bash" }
    ...

    Finished in 0.21769 seconds
    3 examples, 0 failures


Cool, all tests passed! We didn't exactly use behavior-driven development until now, but will do so in the next parts.


I> ## Red-Green Cycle
I>
I> In behavior-driven development (BDD) it is important to write a failing test first and then the code that satisfies the
I> test. The red-green cycle represents the colors that you will see when executing these test: Red first, and then
I> beautiful green. But once your code passes the tests, take yet a little more time to refactor your code. This little
I> mind shift helps you a lot to think more about the problem and how to solve it. The test suite is a nice by product too.
